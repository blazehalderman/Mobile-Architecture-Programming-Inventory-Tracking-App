# Mobile-Architecture-Programming-Inventory-Tracking-App

## Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
- The requirements and goal of the mobile application included designing a fully functioning personal Inventory Management Application, which required a database, personalized UI/UX catering to a specific audience (particularly those looking to track inventory), and have a user experience (login/password). This app was designed to create a personal/professional experience for managing inventory.

## What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
- The screens necessary for the functionality of the application included registration (create account), login (authentication/authorization), Reset password, Home screen for inventory, and add additional inventory items screen. The UI of the application keeps the users at the core of the experience and focuses on making it as fluid as possible. Icons and text are clearly visible and easy to understand, along with ensuring the overall flow of the application stays consistent. This design was successful since I was insightful about my users and researched the psychology and UI experience for my user stories. This helped ensure that my design was targeted at the users, and allowed my applcation to succeed. I also kept security and intuitive design in mind, ensuring that users data was separate from other forms of data that could leave them vulnerable (Separation of user database and items database).


## How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
- I first began designing my application with thoroughly exploring similar application designs as well as designing the flow of my application. This helped with understanding a rough overview of the processes involved in using the application, and allowed me to set the foundation for the app. I then dug deeper into each piece/feature of the application and built each stage in consecutive order to stay true to the user experience. Techniques involved understanding how different user scenarios or stories would affect a feature or screen and the interaction involved. It's important to understand these techniques since these can further be applied in the future by first knowing your users and building the application with them at the core of the experience.

## How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
- I tested my application both functional and implementaion wise by creating dummy accounts and writing tests for specific functionalities. These tests help reveal vulnerabilities in the application such as user access and cross account issues. It's important to write thorough unit tests and implementation tests to ensure the application is covered on both ends of the spectrum.


## Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
- I had to innovate during the user design phase, in terms of the account association with items. I made sure to encrpyt users accounts with their inventory items, that way another user could not reverse-track/reveal personal information. 

## In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
- I was particularly successful in demonstrating security and design concepts in terms of separating users data using two separate databases as well as designing the CRUD flow of the application for inventory items.
